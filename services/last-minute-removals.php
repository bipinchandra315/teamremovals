If it is a small number of goods, we can simply pack and carry them to the new location. If there is a larger amount or a few bulky goods, our last minute movers disassemble them before packing and use a truck or a trailer to transport them.

                                                    Team Removals Australia and got the best team of furniture movers
                                                    and packers who have efficiently relocated my whole stuff from Perth
                                                    to Canberra so quickly. All my goods were damage-free after
                                                    relocation; totally satisfied with their service and will definitely
                                                    hire Team Removals for the next move. Great bunch of movers. Thanks

                                                    I have tried many moving companies before hiring Team Removals
                                                    Australia. Unlike other Team Removals’ customer support staff is
                                                    more active, polite, and has good knowledge of moving services. I
                                                    got the quickest response after submitting, nearly in just 20 mins.
                                                    One of their managers contacted me to get details of my move and
                                                    gave me the best and cheap quote. I high recommend Team Removals for
                                                    this gesture of valuing their customers.
