Then, remove the hardware from the bathtub before moving it. We don't want anything from the bathtub to fall, crack, or bend because it could cause serious injury. Once those are done, we lift the bathtub. Our bathtub removalists will assist you, especially if you are planning on moving the bathtub a long haul. Then we put the bathtub on a dolly, so it is easier to move.

                                Loading a bathtub onto the truck is a tricky thing to do. It demands a lot of patience and works as well. Our experienced bathtub movers in Melbourne use spa removals dollies and sliders to effortlessly load this into the truck. Our spa movers have to access the inside of the truck and make sure the bathtub goes inside smoothly. If it is not loaded properly, the bathtub may crash into the side of the truck and cause harm to the customers. After a safe loading of the bathtub for spa removals, our truck driver transports it to the destined place and stays very careful while driving. We use several different tools and trucks to get bathtubs out of buildings and relocate them safely.

For example, if you book a schedule two days before shifting, and we already have other bookings on the same day you want to move. Then it would become difficult to manage for us, and we would never allow our clients to be disappointed. If the slot is free, we will absolutely serve you efficiently.

                                                    Team Removals Australia and got the best team of furniture movers
                                                    and packers who have efficiently relocated my whole stuff from Perth
                                                    to Canberra so quickly. All my goods were damage-free after
                                                    relocation; totally satisfied with their service and will definitely
                                                    hire Team Removals for the next move. Great bunch of movers. Thanks

                                                    I have tried many moving companies before hiring Team Removals
                                                    Australia. Unlike other Team Removals’ customer support staff is
                                                    more active, polite, and has good knowledge of moving services. I

                                                    One of their managers contacted me to get details of my move and
                                                    gave me the best and cheap quote. I high recommend Team Removals for
                                                    this gesture of valuing their customers.

                                                    furniture removals and storage for one year. And they have delivered
                                                    me the best moving and storage services in Australia. Whenever I

                                                    and safe. They packed and delivered my goods after a year with no
                                                    damage or fungus on any of my items. I 100% recommend Team Removals
